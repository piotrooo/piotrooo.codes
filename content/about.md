Scratches, thoughts, samples, and bugs on this blog are generated by me, who am currently a Backend Tech Lead
at [thulium.com](https://thulium.com).

All this stuff will revolve around Java and Spring (Boot) topics. I also have solid knowledge of PHP *(sic!)* topics,
although I'm not especially proud of it.

*All opinions are mine and mine alone.*
